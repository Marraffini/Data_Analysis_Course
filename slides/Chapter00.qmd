## Introduction

Why am I in this course? 

Why do I need to learn this stuff?


## Choices, choices everywhere

The goal of this course is not to make perfect little replicas of our thinking.

Instead we aim to give you some tools to approach data analysis.

Most of life is not about following instructions; it is about navigating ambiguity.

There is almost always more than one way to do things in this course.

How do I make decisions when things aren't clear? and is that the way I want to be making them?


## What is data analysis?

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. (wikipedia)

## Getting started with R

We will be using the programming language R for our data analysis

R is the language

R studio is the graphical user interface (GUI)


 ![](img/R_logo.png)  
If you have not installed R and R studio on your computer please see the resources page on Stream and studyguide material about how to do that.


## Getting started with R

Without R, it would take hours each day to manage data in the best case scenario. In a worst case scenario, it could take the entire day looking at data and fixing mistakes from cutting and pasting. Trying to remember what order you pressed buttons in last time or where the button moved to now that the software has updated.
None of this is accounting for the cost of accessing any of the proprietary software. 

*Advantages of R*

- Free!
- Save your workflow: reuse when data is updated
- Explicit and transparent: steps are shown
- Serves multiple functions: organise, analyses, communicate


## Learning R

Learning any skill from scratch is going to be challenging at first. 

R is no exception. 

You must consistently practice R in order to retain any information.

Making mistakes is part of learning. We learn a lot from failure.

## Some `R` basics {.unnumbered}

-   `R` is case sensitive, so `data` is not the same as `DATA`

-   Similarly beware of spaces and punctuation, particularly in column header

-   `<-` (read as "gets") is the assignment operator. That is, you use
    `<-` to assign some content to a variable. The operator `=` has a
    slightly different meaning but it can be used in the same way as `<-`. 

-   Comments are denoted by the \# symbol. Anything after a `#` symbol
    is ignored by `R` . This is a great way to write yourself notes.


## Some `R` basics {.unnumbered}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
colorize <- function(x, color) {
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    sprintf("\\textcolor{%s}{%s}", color, x)
  } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
    sprintf("<span style='color: %s;'>%s</span>", color, 
      x)
  } else x
}

```

-   R coding can be hard to write from scratch. 
    `r colorize("So do not hesitate to adopt R codes written by others.", "red")`
    Search the internet for R code to do what you want to do. The usual `copy and paste` trick works!
    
-   Warnings vs error messages: R gives warnings typically in `r colorize("orange", "orange")` and errors in `r colorize("red", "red")`. A warning means your code likely ran but there is something you should be aware of while an error means your code did not run. We recommend first trying to understand what the error is saying, check for common mistakes (missing failing to close a bracket or quotation, misspelling, capitalization, etc. ), then try to google your error message.



## R as a calulator

At the most basic level R is a calculator. 

We can type mathematical equations directly into R.

```{r, echo =TRUE}
2 + 2

sqrt(16) # take the square root
```



## R Objects, Model Syntax etc. {.unnumbered}

In R, we work with objects. There are different classes of objects including:

`character`, `integer`, `numeric`, `vector`, `matrix`,
`array`, `data.frame`, `list`, `lm` (linear model). 

An object may belong to several classes at once.

Understanding the data type is essential for knowing what you can

## R Objects, Model Syntax etc. {.unnumbered}

Suppose that your data consists of 4 numbers say 1 to 4. We can combine these numbers using the `c()` function namely `c(1,2,3,4)` and then assign it to `x`, an object.

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
```



Evidently `x` is a vector and also belongs to other classes of objects. This can be queried as follows:

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
is(x)
```

The main class it belongs to is queried as

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
class(x)
```

## R Objects, Model Syntax etc. {.unnumbered}

Our data are actually integers and arranged in a pattern. So we can
define `x` as follows:

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4
```

The colon (`:`) operator created the desired pattern. Alternative
expressions include

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- seq(1, 4, by=1)
``` 

Try `is(x)` and `class(x)` and check whether our data are recognised as integer class.

## R mathematical expressions {.unnumbered}

We can do many mathematical manipulations on `x`. Try

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
mean(x)
min(x)
max(x)
sum(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
sort(x, T)
trunc(x/2)
```

## Accessing objects in R
Vector elements are accessed by square brackets, `[]`. Try

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x[2]+x[4]
x[2:3]
x[c(1,3)]
x[-2]
```

## Types of data in R
Assume that our data are actually categorical codes. Then the correct way of defining the character data is to use single quotes as

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```

Now try Try `is(x)` and `class(x)`. For large patterned categorical
data, placing quotes is laborious. So we can change the class as
follows:

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- as.character(1:4)
```

## Combining data
Assume that you have two batches of data. The first one is

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4 
```

and the second one is

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
y <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```

These two batches can be combined into a matrix as follows:

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- cbind(x,y)
```

Here the matrix `m` is formed by binding the columns (vectors). The
other option is to bind as rows

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- rbind(x,y)
```


Evidently vectors must be of the same length for these commands to work. 
We can also form a matrix by splitting a vector. Try

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:6
m <- matrix(x, byrow = TRUE, ncol = 3)
m <- matrix(x, byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2)
```

To access the first of row of the matrix `m`, we use `m[1,]`; to access the first column of `m`, we use `m[,1]`.

## Data frame

A `data frame` is an R object that contains vectors; the vectors are
stored vertically in a matrix like structure, and can be referred to by the name of the column. The main advantage of a data frame is that the variables in a data frame do not all need to be the same type; e.g. some variables can be of class numeric, and some variables can be of class character. We can create a data frame object using the `data.frame()` function. This data frame contains two small vectors, the first of which is named `ID`, and the second `NAME`. Try 

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4
y <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
my.data <-data.frame(ID=x, NAME=y)
my.data 
```

We can access the original vector of interest in the following way:

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
my.data$NAME
```

## Matrices

There are times when it is useful to convert a data frame into a matrix; we can do this with the `as.matrix()` function.

```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- as.matrix(my.data)
```

Type `class(m)` and see the changes.

Two data frames can also be merged into a single data frame using the `merge` command.

The internal structure of an R object can be viewed using the diagnostic function `str()`.


## Directories

Directories are a location for storing files on your computer. Information (documents) is stored in folders the location of that folder is called a directory. You can think of this as the address of the file.

![](img/file-cabinet.png){height=4in}

## Directories

![](img/directory.png)

This full address of the file is also called a path. 

For example on my computer my slides for this class are located in a folder called 'slides' inside 'Data_Analysis_course'. The last part of the path is the most specific folder which is nested inside parent folders.



## Set directory in R

In RStudio, set the working directory under the *Session* menu. It is a good idea to start your analysis as a new project in the File menu so that the entire work and data files can be saved and re-opened easily later on.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
getwd() # check your working directory

# setwd() # if you know the directory you want R to look in
```

## Quarto

This course will be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) `*.qmd` files rather than raw `*.R` files. 

Quarto is the successor to Rmarkdown. 

Quarto files contain text and code, and can be 'Rendered' to produce a nicely formatted document, usually in HTML or PDF format, containing sections, text, code, plots, and output. Quarto can also be used to make websites; in fact, the website for this course was made using Quarto.

Here's some information to get you started: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>.

And some other useful tips: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto>.


## Loading data

Most data sets we shall consider in this course are in a tabular form. This means that each variable is a column, each row is an observation, columns are separated by white space (or comma), and each column or row may have a name. 

If the data file is stored locally, you should put the data into the same directory as your Quarto or R markdown script. That way, you can (usually) load it easily without having to type the full pathway (e.g., `mydata.csv` rather than `C:/Users/anhsmith/Work/Project1/data/mydata.csv`). 


```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| code-fold: show
rangitikei <- read_csv("../data/rangitikei.csv")
```

We usually store the data in an R object, here named `rangitikei`.

## Types of data files

The letters after the `.` at the end of a files name are called the extension and tell you the type of file. 

*"comma separated values"* (`.csv`) : `read.csv()` or `read_csv()` function to load the file. 

*text file* (`.txt`): `read.table()` or `read_table()` function. 

The ones with underscores ( `read_csv()` and `read_table()` ) are in the `readr` package, so you'll need to load it first (though `readr` is part of `tidyverse`, so if you load `tidyverse` you're all set). 

You can also load Microsoft Excel files using functions `read_excel()`, available in the `readxl` package.

Note that Excel files usually contain blanks for missing or unreported data or allocate many rows for variable description, which can cause issues while importing them.

## Loading packages

Many (but not all) R packages are hosted at a repository called CRAN (*C*omprehensive *R* *A*rchive *N*etwork). The package install option within RStudio can download and install these optional packages under the menu `Packages >> Install`. You can also do this using the command
`install.packages`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| message: false
# install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

In this course we will use multiple packages. You need to load them with the library() function every time you run a script/R session but you only need to install them once.

## Welcome to the tidyverse

We will be largely using the `tidyverse` suite of packages for data organisation, summarising, and plotting; see <https://www.tidyverse.org/>.

Let's load that package now:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

Recommended reading to accompany this workshop is pages 1-11 of R for Data Science <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>

## Tidy data

There are three interrelated rules that make a dataset tidy:

-   Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
-   Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
-   Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

![Tidy data](img/tidy_data.png){#fig-tidy} 

## Why ensure that your data is tidy? 

There are two main advantages:

-   If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

-   Placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorized nature to shine. Most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. 

dplyr, ggplot2, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data. 


## Summarizing data

Summarizing data is a large part of data analysis.

We summarize data in general because it provides us with a way to generalize - that is, to make general statements that extend beyond specific observations. 

What is a summary?

- Tables
- Frequency distributions 
- Cumulative distributions
- Histograms



## `dplyr` {.unnumbered}

The following six functions of `dplyr` are very useful for data
wrangling:

-   For selecting columns, use `select()`
-   For subsetting data, use `filter()`
-   For re-ordering (e.g. ascending/descending), use `arrange()`
-   For augmenting new calculated columns, use `mutate()`
-   For computing summary measures, use `summarise()`
-   For group-wise computations (e.g. summary measures), use
    `group_by()`

There are many other functions such as `transmute()` which will add newly calculated columns to the existing data frame but drop all unused columns. 

The `across()` function  extends `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions for multiple column and function summaries.  

For example, you like to report rounded data in a table, which calls for an operation across both rows and columns.

## Piping

::: {.callout-tip}

**The piping operation is a fundamental aspect of computer programming. The semantics of pipes is taking the output from the left-hand side and passing it as input to the right-hand side.**

:::

The `R` package `magrittr` introduced the pipe operator `%>%` and can be pronounced as "then". In RStudio windows/Linux versions, press `Ctrl+Shift+M` to insert the pipe operator. On a Mac, use `Cmd+Shift+M`. 

`R` also has its own pipe, `|>`, which is an alternative to `%>%`.  If you want to change the pipe inserted automatically with `Ctrl+Shift+M`, find on the menu **Tools > Global Options**, then click on **Code** and check the box that says "**Use Native Pipe Operator**". 

We often pipe the `dplyr` functions, and the advantage is that we show the flow of data manipulation and subsequent graphing. This approach also helps to save memory, and dataframes are not unnecessarily created, a necessity for a big data framework.


## Tidying data

The principles of tidy data might seem so obvious that you wonder if you’ll ever encounter a dataset that isn’t tidy. Unfortunately, however, most real data is (very) untidy. There are two main reasons:

-   Data is often organized to facilitate some goal other than analysis. For example, it’s common for data to be structured to make data entry easy.

-   Most people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data, and it’s hard to derive them yourself unless you spend a lot of time working with data.

This means that most real analyses will require at least a little tidying. You’ll begin by figuring out what the underlying variables and observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you’ll need to consult with the people who originally generated the data.

## Tidying data example

The hospital admissions dataset is untidy because it does allocate many
columns for a variable.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hospital <- read.table(
  "../data/hospital.txt",
  header=TRUE, sep=",")
  
head(hospital)
```



This format is also called `wide format` which can be made into a tidy `long format`. We will discuss this more later in the course.



## Importance of Data Quality Control Process 

Decision-making: 

    High-quality data ensures that decisions are based on accurate information.

Operational Efficiency: 

    Reliable data is crucial for an efficient manufacturing. 

Customer Satisfaction: 

    Accurate customer data contributes to improved customer satisfaction.

Compliance:

    Complying with regulations requires accurate and secure data handling. 

Trust and Credibility: 

    Builds trust with stakeholders, customers, and partners.


## Data Quality

Accuracy: Refers to the correctness of data. 

Completeness: Addresses whether all necessary data is present. 

Consistency: Ensures uniformity and coherence across data sets. 

Timeliness: Timely data is up-to-date and aligns with the current context. 

Relevance: Relevant data is directly applicable to the analysis or decision-making process.

Validity: Valid data meets the criteria set for its format and structure.

Reliability: Reliable data remains accurate and consistent across various timeframes.

Precision: Precise data is specific and avoids unnecessary granularity or ambiguity.

      
## Data Quality Checks {.unnumbered}

-   Inaccurate entries

      Typos, spelling, capitalization

-   Missing data

      Empty cells or rows

-   Outliers/Unrealistic entries

      Large numbers, negative numbers, etc. 
      Age should fall within a realistic range (e.g., 0 to 120 years)
      

## Common data issues

-   Spelling, capitalization, typos, and white spaces

      there are some handy functions in `stringr` and `janitor` packages 
      *case_when()* in dplyr can be very helpful for rename or reclassifying observations

-   NAs: there is a difference between not observed, not recorded, and not applicable. This difference requires understanding of the data and data entry process for that project

      can remove NAs using `na.omit()`, `!is.na()`, `na.rm=T`, etc. depending on what function you are using. See help menu for more details
      
-   Multiple types of data in a single column or wrong data type

      can force a data class using `as.numeric()` for example 

-   Multiple entries of the same observation

      `janitor` package has a function get\_dupes() to find duplicate entries 
      or the distinct() function from dplyr.
         

## Missing Data {.unnumbered}

*Missing completely at random* (MCAR) is often used to mean
there is there is no pattern to the missing data themselves or
alternatively the missingness is not related to any other variable or
data in the dataset. 

*Missing at random (MAR)* data is data conditionally missing at random. 

For example a particular survey question, the response rate may differ depending on the respondent's gender. In this situation, the actual missingness may be random but still related to the
gender variable.

*Missing not at random (MNAR)* is the pattern when missingness is
related to other variables in the dataset, as well as the values of the
missing data are not random. 

There are also situations such as censoring where we just record a
single value without actually measuring the variable of interest.

## Data Quality Checks: Example

It is a good idea to check the quality of secondary data sourced from elsewhere. For example, there could be missing values in the dataset. Consider the Telomeres data downloaded from
<https://rs.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/22850096>

```{r}
# #| eval: false
# url <- "https://rs.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/22850096"
# destfile <- "rsos192136_si_001.xlsx"
# # 
# download.file(url, destfile)

```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
url <- "https://rs.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/22850096"
destfile <- "rsos192136_si_001.xlsx"

curl::curl_download(url, destfile)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(readxl)
rsos192136_si_001 <- read_excel("../data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx")
```

The missingness of data can be quickly explored using many R packages. The downloaded Telomeres dataset contain many missing values.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(VIM)

res <- rsos192136_si_001 |> 
  aggr(sortVar=TRUE) |> 
  summary() |> 
  pluck("combinations")
```

## Missing Data {.unnumbered}

Imputation of data can be made except for the case of MCAR type. A
number of R packages are available for data imputation; see
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html> or
<https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/>. We may occasionally cover data
imputation issue in an assignment question.


## Data Quality Checks {.unnumbered}
There are also R packages to perform automatic investigation for data
cleaning. Try-

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| eval: false

library(dataMaid)

makeDataReport(rsos192136_si_001, output="html", replace=TRUE)

# or
library(DataExplorer)

create_report(rsos192136_si_001)

```
