## The nature of data: random variables

Data come from recording observations of the world. E.g.,

-   recording the number of heart beats per minute
-   counting birds in your yard
-   measuring the lengths of fish you catch

Each time you collect one of these observations, it is likely to be different.

-   Pulse may vary between 55 and 70 bpm, depending on when you record it
-   Number of birds varies at different times, and across different yards.

We call these **random variables** (often denoted with an upper case letter, $X$), because the particular value that a single observation or measurement will take is uncertain. The value varies across observations.

## Types of data

![](img/data_types.png){.preview-image}

## Subtypes of *qual*itative data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
<br>

-   **Nominal variables** have no particular order <br>(e.g., gender, colour, species, country)

<br><br><br><br>

-   **Ordinal variables** can be ordered <br>(e.g., altitude = {low, mid, high}, <br>age group = {child, juvenile, adult} )

## Subtypes of *quant*itative data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
<br>

-   **Continuous variables** have no gaps between possible values, as in measurements (e.g., weight, temperature, length)

<br><br><br>

-   **Discrete variables** have gaps between possible values, as in counts (e.g., number of siblings, number of flowers)

## Subtypes of continuous data

<br>

### Interval scale

-   No absolute zero
-   Division & subtraction may not be meaningful
-   Temperature in degrees Celcius is interval because 20°C is not twice as hot as 10°C.

<br>

### Ratio scale

-   Zero = zero
-   All arithmetic manipulation can be done
-   Length is ratio because 20 mm is twice as long as 10 mm.

## Data Collection: Survey, Experiment, Census 

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}

-   We collect data from the world to get information about patterns and processes. 

-   Most datasets contain a subset, a **sample**, of a much bigger population of interest.
      
      +   We may conduct a **survey** to collect a sample of data from different places, times, people, or organisms. We would rarely survey all of them.
      
      +   We might conduct an **experiment** where we take a sample of elements (people, organisms, objects) and apply some **treatment** in a lab (e.g., drug, temperature, exercise regime, or other treatment) to study its effects.

-   If we are not dealing with a sample, if *every* element of the population of interest is represented in the dataset, we call this a **census** rather than a **sample**.

## Measurement issues

-   Measuring Devices or Instruments

    -   a physical device - measuring rule to gauge the heights of plants
    -   a counting device - a Geiger- counter for measuring radioactive material
    -   a questionnaire - requires a more subjective response.

-   Measurement Error

    -   measuring instrument may be *faulty* (bias)
    -   values recorded from the same object may vary from one measurement to another (variance)

-   Indirect measures

    -   For example, we use Body Mass Index (BMI) as a measure of condition, and we measure temperature with the expansion of mercury.

## Non-response

-   a *non-sampling error*

-   **Selection stage:** an element may be selected but not found

    -   e.g. sheep in a flock may be tagged with individual identification number but one may not be found at the time of the survey.

-   **Collection stage:** it may not be possible to take a measurement

    -   some respondents may forget, or refuse, to answer the questionnaire

-   **Documentation stage**

    -   Incorrect record of measurement

-   **Call-backs** reduce non-response

## Census related concepts

**TARGET POPULATION** the population under study

**FRAME** operationalises data collection from a target population. e.g. listing of elements in population.

**ACTUAL POPULATION** is the resulting set of elements on which usable data have been collected.

![](img/census.jpg)

## Sample *vs* population

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   A **sample** is a subset of the population.

-   Datasets usually only contain a sample from the population; rarely do we have the entire population of data!

-   Why sample?

    -   Sampling conserves resources (money, time, etc.).
    -   A well collected sample is more useful than a badly designed census.
    -   Collecting data may be destructive.
    -   The disadvantage: the statistics we calculate from sample data is subject to ***sampling variation**, which introduces* uncertainty\* about their true values.

## Population, frame, and sample

![](img/sample.jpg)

## Statistical inference

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[***Statistical inference*** is the process of using information from sample data to make conclusions about the population.]{style="color:#E46C0A;"}

<br>

For example, we want to know $\mu$, mean length of fish in a population. So, we collect a sample of fish, measure their lengths, calculate the mean $\bar{x}$, and use $\bar{x}$ as an estimate of $\mu$. This is *statistical inference*.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/inference.png)
:::
:::

The sample mean $\bar{x}$ depends on *which particular fish we happened to get in our sample*.

Therefore, the sample mean $\bar{x}$ itself is a random variable.

If we were to take 1000 different samples, we'd get 1000 different means.

## Bias *vs* sampling variance

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A method used to estimate $\hat{\theta}$ a population parameter $\theta$ is called an ***estimator***. An estimator includes the study design, methods of data collection, and mathematical operations.

***Sampling variance*** is the sample-to-sample variation in an estimator.

***Bias*** is when our estimator *doesn't get it right on average*. That is, the average of estimates over $\infty$ samples is not centred on the population parameter; $\text{Mean}(\hat{\theta}) \neq \theta$.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/bullseye.png)
:::
:::

An estimator can have high/low sampling variance and high/low bias.

## Principle of randomisation

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}

-   We want our sample to be representative of (and have similar properties to) the population. The most straightforward way to do this is through *randomisation*.

-   We randomise the selection of objects for our sample to avoid **bias**. If we (consciously or subconsciously) tended to chose the largest fish for our sample, we'd get an upwardly biased estimate of the lengths.

-   Simple random sampling or *EPSEM* (equal probability of selection) is the gold standard of random sampling.

## Simple Random Sampling (SRS)


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
-   **Random selection of elements** 

    -   "Random" refers to the *process* not *outcome*
    -   Each (sampling) unit has same chance of being selected
    -   Units can be selected with & without replacement


:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](img/random_sample.png)
:::
::::

-   SRS is easy to handle; suits even for a poor sampling frame

-   SRS can be costly to implement

-   SRS estimates are more variable than some alternatives

:::


## Stratified Random Sampling (STRS)


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


-   Suitable for *heterogeneous* populations

-   Population is divided into relatively homogeneous groups called *strata* and a random sample is taken from each *stratum*.

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](img/stratified_sample.png)
:::
::::
-   Sampling Approaches

    -   Sample the larger strata more heavily (suits when all the strata are equally variable)
    -   Sample the more varied strata are sampled

-   Advantages of STRS

    -   leads to efficient estimation That is, the variance (of an estimate) is usually less than that of SRS
    -   sample is spread throughout population

:::{.absolute top=270 right=50 style="font-size: 50%;"}
[Smith et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02821)
:::

## Cluster sampling


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
-   A convenient method of sampling

-   population is composed of *clusters* (groups)

-   Select certain clusters (randomly) and collect measurements from a random selection of the elements within the chosen clusters

-   Larger variance than SRS!

:::

## Systematic Random sampling (SyRS)


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

-   Select every $k^{th}$ element!

-   Random start within the first block of elements.

    -   Convenient and also the sample will be representative of population

    -   Variance of estimates - generally greater than those of SRS

    -   Inefficient/inappropriate, if cycle or trend is present

## Other Sampling methods

-   Probability proportional to size (PPS)
    -   e.g., sampling high-value companies more likely than low-value companies
-   Multistage
    -   e.g., first stage - cluster; second stage - SRS

-   Non-probability sampling methods

    -   Haphazard / opportunistic / volunteer; take what you can get! 
    -   Snowball; get your participants to find new participants
    -   Purposive; select items with certain characteristics; e.g., patients with particular symptoms

-   Non-probability samples are often treated as random, requiring the assumption that the sample is representative. The validity of this assumption should be carefully considered.

## Some sampling methods

![](img/1_5.png)

## Effective Sample size (thumb rule)

| Sample Design | Design Effect ($d$) | Effective Sample Size ($\frac{n}{d}$) |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| SRS           | 1.00                | $n$                                   |
| STRS          | 0.80 to 0.90        | $\frac{n}{0.9}$ to $\frac{n}{0.8}$    |
| Cluster       | 1.02 to 1.26        | $\frac{n}{1.26}$ to $\frac{n}{1.02}$  |
| SyRS          | 1.05                | $\frac{n}{1.05}$                      |
| Quota         | 2                   | $\frac{n}{2}$                         |

## Summary

-   Issues to address

    -   WHAT are collected?
    -   WHO does the data collection?
    -   HOW are the data collected?

-   Bias occurs due to

    -   SELECTION
    -   COLLECTION
    -   NON-RESPONSE (the single largest cause of bias!)

-   A sample may have the same biases as a census along with *sampling errors*
