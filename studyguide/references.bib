	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {Boxplots are useful displays that convey rough information about the distribution of a variable. Boxplots were designed to be drawn by hand and work best for small datasets, where detailed estimates of tail behavior beyond the quartiles may not be trustworthy. Larger datasets afford more precise estimates of tail behavior, but boxplots do not take advantage of this precision, instead presenting large numbers of extreme, though not unexpected, observations. Letter-value plots address this problem by including more detailed information about the tails using “letter values,” an order statistic defined by Tukey. Boxplots display the first two letter values (the median and quartiles); letter-value plots display further letter values so far as they are reliable estimates of their corresponding quantiles. We illustrate letter-value plots with real data that demonstrate their usefulness for large datasets. All graphics are created using the R package lvplot, and code and data are available in the supplementary materials.},

	abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},
